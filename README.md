# Corona Test Management 
#### The idea for this application was to create a Coronavirus Test Management system. This system could be used at testing facilities. The application allows for users to apply for testing by selecting the type of test they are wanting and when they would like to get tested, then an admin user would be able to see all the requests for testing and then be able to either approve them or reject them. Users will also be given recommendations for testing frequency. Which can be adjusted by the admin
